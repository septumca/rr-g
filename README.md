### Quick introduction
Simple, rugby-like simultaneous turn game, with [Frozen Cortex](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237350/Frozen_Cortex/) as primary inspiration

### Some not so technical stuff
Simple game project to learn me some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [ECS engine](https://bevyengine.org/). As probably everyone, I've tried to make something happen and failed countless of times in the past, so let's see if this time would be different. It's also good opportunity to check github features in more detail.

Code will be a mess, but maybe it would regardless help someone who's using same technology stack, and is struggling with same issues as me. Maybe there will be even list here for quick reference. Who knows?

### Some technical stuff
It's all done in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine and [Rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier) for physics
So far all "art" is done by myself with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
